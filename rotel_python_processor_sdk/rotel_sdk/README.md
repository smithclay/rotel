# rotel-sdk üå∂Ô∏è üçÖ

Python type hints package for the Rotel processor SDK.

## Description

This package provides type hints for the Rotel processor SDK and is intended for use with your Python LSP (pyright or
other) in your IDE of choice. [Rotel](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel/) is an efficient, high-performance solution
for collecting, processing, and
exporting telemetry data. Rotel is ideal for resource-constrained environments and applications where minimizing
overhead is critical.

When using a [Python processor enabled](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel/releases/) release of Rotel, you can write
native Python
code to process and filter your telemetry data before sending to an exporter. Rotel
provides Rust binding for Python with the [pyo3](https://crates.io/crates/pyo3) create to provide a high-performance
OpenTelemetry processor API bundled as a Python extension.

## Getting Started

In order to use the Rotel Python processor SDK you will need to either build from source using the `--features pyo3`
flag or download the latest [Python processor enabled version of Rotel](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel/releases/).
Python
processor versions of Rotel are prefixed with `rotel_py_processor`. Choose the release that matches your system
architecture and the version of Python you have installed .

For example is you are going to run Rotel and write processors on `x86_64` with `Python 3.13` download and install...

[rotel_py_processor_3.13_v0.0.1-alpha5_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/streamfold/rotel/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha5/rotel_py_processor_3.13_v0.0.1-alpha5_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

### Setting up a rotel processor development environment

Create a new virtual environment and install the rotel-sdk

```commandline
mkdir /tmp/rotel_processors_example; cd /tmp/rotel_processors_example
python -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install rotel-sdk --pre
```

### Writing a trace processor with the `process(resource_spans: ResourceSpans)` function.

Your processor must implement a function called `process` in order for rotel to execute your processor. Each time
process is called
your processor will be handed a instance of the `ResourceSpan` class for you to manipulate as you like.

## Trace processor example

The following is an example OTel trace processor called `append_resource_attributes_to_spans.py` which adds the OS
name, version,
and a timestamp named
`rotel.process.time` to the Resource Attributes of a batch of Spans. Open up your editor or Python IDE and paste the
following into a file called `append_resource_attributes_to_spans.py` and run with the following command.

```python
import platform
from datetime import datetime

from rotel_sdk.open_telemetry.resource.v1 import Resource
from rotel_sdk.open_telemetry.common.v1 import KeyValue
from rotel_sdk.open_telemetry.trace.v1 import ResourceSpans


def process(resource_spans: ResourceSpans):
    resource = resource_spans.resource
    # If resource is None, we'll create a new one to store our attributes, otherwise we'll append to the existing Resource
    if resource is None:
        resource = Resource()

    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    os_name = platform.system()
    os_version = platform.release()
    # Add attributes
    resource.attributes.append(KeyValue.new_string_value("os.name", os_name))
    resource.attributes.append(KeyValue.new_string_value("os.version", os_version))
    resource.attributes.append(KeyValue.new_string_value("rotel.process.time", current_time))

```

Now start rotel and the processor with the following command and use a load generator to generate some spans and send to
rotel. When you view the spans
in your observability backend you should now see the newly added attributes.

`./rotel start --otlp-exporter-endpoint <otlp-endpoint-url> --otlp-with-trace-processor ./append_resource_attributes_to_spans.py`

## Logs processor example

For logs let's try something a little different. The following is an example OTel log processor called
`redact_emails_in_logs.py`. This script checks to see if LogRecords have a body that contains email addresses.
If an email is found, we redact the email and replace it with the string `**[email redacted]**`.
Open up your editor or Python IDE and paste the following into a file called `redact_emails_in_logs.py` and run with the
following command.

```python
import re

from rotel_sdk.open_telemetry.common.v1 import AnyValue
from rotel_sdk.open_telemetry.logs.v1 import ResourceLogs

email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'


def process(resource_logs: ResourceLogs):
    for scope_log in resource_logs.scope_logs:
        for log_record in scope_log.log_records:
            if log_record.body is not None and log_record.body.value is not None:
                if re.search(email_pattern, log_record.body.value):
                    log_record.body = redact_emails(log_record.body.value)


def redact_emails(text: str):
    """
    Searches for email addresses in a string and replaces them with '*** redacted'
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for email addresses
        
    Returns:
        str: The string with email addresses replaced by '*** redacted'
    """
    new_body = AnyValue()
    new_body.string_value = re.sub(email_pattern, '**[email redacted]**', text)
    return new_body
```

Now start rotel and the processor with the following command and use a load generator to send some log messages to rotel
that contain email addresses.
When you view the logs in your observability backend you should now see the email address are redacted.

`./rotel start --otlp-exporter-endpoint <otlp-endpoint-url> --otlp-with-logs-processor ./redact_emails_in_logs.py`

For this example we'll use a log body with the following content.

```text
192.168.1.45 - - [23/May/2025:14:32:17 +0000] "POST /contact-form HTTP/1.1" 200 1247 "https://example.com/contact" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36" "email=john.doe@company.com&subject=Support Request&message=Need help with login issues"
```
